The following are code examples from my presentation "All About Async
Javascript", given at the Appnexus NY Office on October 24th, 2013. The talk is
meant to provide a high level overview, followed by a deep dive, into
asynchronous mechanisms provided by most javascript runtimes. The examples are
self-documenting, so feel free to peruse them as you see fit.
